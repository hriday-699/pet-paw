                    (a) As per constitutional provision, management of stray animals is the mandate of local bodies
of the State however, the Central Government has notified the Animal Birth Control Rules,
2023 vide G.S.R. 193(E) dated 10th March, 2023 under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
Act, 1960 after superseding the Animal Birth Control (Dog) Rules, 2001.
As per Rule 3(1), the local authority may conduct the Animal Birth Control Program to
reduce the stray dogs. As per Rule 9 (3) of the said Rules, the formation of Central Animal
Birth Control Monitoring & Coordination Committee, State Animal Birth Control
Implementation and Monitoring Committee and local Animal Birth Control Monitoring

The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in writ petition no. 691 of 2009 between Animal
Welfare Board of India and People for Elimination of Stray Troubles, directs that
"….Needless to emphasize, no innovative method or subterfuge should be adopted not to
carry out the responsibility under the 1960 Act or the 2001 Rules. Any kind of laxity while
carrying out statutory obligations, is not countenanced in law….". Hence, it is stated that the
stray dog can only be managed by controlling their population through Animal Birth Control.(b) The direction of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court has been included in the Animal Birth
Control Rules, 2023. As per Rule 20(1) of the ABC Rules, 2023, it shall be the responsibility

representative of that area to make necessary arrangement for feeding of community animals.
As per Rule 20(2), an animal welfare committee shall be formed to resolve the conflict
between the RWA or AOA and the animal caregivers or other residents.
The Animal Welfare Board of India, on receipt of the various complaints from animal
caregivers, individually requests the concerned RWA to form the animal welfare committee
to resolve the dispute regarding feeding of community animals. After the Delhi High Court
Order, the Board has so far issued 83 letters to the RWAs in the state of Delhi for
