                    What is a dog breed?.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    People have been breeding dogs since
prehistoric times. The earliest dog breeders
used wolves to create domestic dogs. From
he beginning, humans purposefully bred
ogs to perform various tasks. Hunting,
uarding, and herding are thought to be
among the earliest jobs eagerly performed by
he animal destined to be called "man's best freind.For thousands of years, humans bred dogs toward the physical and mental traits best suited
for the work expected of them. The sleek Greyhound types bred to chase fleet-footed prey,
and the huge mastiff types used as guard dogs and warriors, are two ancient examples of
dogs bred for specific jobs.
